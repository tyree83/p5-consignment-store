#### Explanation
used React.js to make a SPA. in order to make the app more response without refresing. used components to structure and style the entire page.

used Express.js, mongoDB and mongoose to set up my database. users are able to register and save their information in the DB. passwords are encrypted and Salted.

#### Approach
-I use the trello board to design the approach a user would take once inside the app. I was able to design it with a wireframe. With those two ready I was able to move forward with my project.
